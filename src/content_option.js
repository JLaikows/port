    "Hi, I’m Josh, a software engineer from the New York / New Jersey area. I’m fluent in Typescript, Javascript, React, Redux, Express, Nodejs, Golang, and more! I graduated from App Academy, an immersive coding bootcamp with over 1000+ hours dedicated to exploring and experimenting with the previous technologies. From there I went on to work for Better Mortgage, an innovative mortgage platform designed to streamline and expedite the mortgage application process for a more efficient and customer-centric experience.",

    "I'm a software enigneer originally from Sayreville, New Jersey. From a young age I found my self fasinated by how technology worked, eventually leading me to video games and more. As I got older, and my muse diverged to music, I still found myself trying to build little applications to make my music reoording experience easier. Then, during the beggining of the pandemic, I went to App Academy to learn full stack engineering, and the rest is history",
